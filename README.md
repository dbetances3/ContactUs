# ContactUs Form in ASP.NET 
Using C# And VB.NET
This contact page lets users send comments or feedback about site or contact site admins. 
I created a working SMTP server through which aspx.page can send the form data to admins email id.
Please note that i placed the word (password instead of my real password for security reasons) 
Please add your own password if you copy this script, but since i am publising this on Github i have to exclude that.
So for this example a gmail account was used to send email on behalf of the application to admins gmail id.
The HTML source of page 
the code in click Event of Submit button using C#
you can also see the code in click Event of submit button using VB.NET

make sure you enable access to google for less secure apps to work, once you do that then you will be able to see the message sent to
you in your gmail mailbox.
